                                <p>Comp 40 is a C-based programming course that challenged me to deeply understand the intimate relationship between hardware and software. To achieve this understanding, I completed 9 major assignments, which ranged from high-level and abstraction heavy to as low a level as working with assembly language and manually packing bits into 64-bit integers. </p> 
                                <p>Although this course was by far the most work-intensive class I've ever taken, it was also the most rewarding, as coding at such a high intensity for an entire semester really helped me turn the corner from introductory programming to programming as a professional, with a deep understanding of computer hardware and the way data and code are represented at the machine level.</p>

                                                        <li>Implemented an algorithm that takes a PPM image and compresses the image to a new format consisting of 64-bit "words"</li>
                                                        <li>Learned about packing and unpacking multiple values (signed and unsigned)into/from words, as well as other bitwise arithmetic (hense the name of the assignment)</li>

                                                        <li>Implemented a universal machine, which consisted of an instruction set that is executed using general memory segmented into 32-bit words and 8 registers. </li>
                                                        <li> All future assignments required me to modify or build on this code in some way, including optimizing performance, writing a macro assembler, and implementing a RPN calculator utilizing only the instructions and macros defined in earlier assignments.</li>
