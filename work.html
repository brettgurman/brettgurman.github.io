                        Some work can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/brettgurman">personal github</a>, but much of the interesting code I have written has been for assigments for my CS courses. In many cases, academic honesty standards prevent me from posting this code to a public source, such as a public github repo. As a workaround, I have posted such work to private github repositories and, upon request, am more than happy to add you, the employer, as a collaborator on these projects so that you may view the code.

                                <p>Comp 40 is a C-based programming course that challenged me to deeply understand the intimate relationship between hardware and software. To achieve this understanding, I completed 9 major assignments, which ranged from high-level and abstraction heavy to as low a level as working with assembly language and manually packing bits into 64-bit integers. Although this course was by far the most work-intensive class I've ever taken, it was also the most rewarding, as coding at such a high intensity for an entire semester really helped me turn the corner from introductory programming to programming as a professional, with a deep understanding of computer hardware and the way data and code are represented at the machine level.</p>

                        <p>Comp 105 introduces students to the study of programming languages and their implementations, and was the first time I combined code and math. This course was also my first introduction to functional programming. Topics covered included abstract syntax, type systems/polymorphism, lambda calculus, and garbage collection, as well as others.</p>
